# OCDX Web Application

## What is OCDX
The premise behind OCDX is that online behavior creates an enormous amount of digital data that can be used for social science research. Research into human-computer interaction dates back to 1995. Up until now, this research has been conducted independently benefiting only the site holder who has access to data they mine from their users. However, there is a large amount of interest in knowing how humans interact with technology.

**Open Community Data Exchange** (OCDX) is an infrastructure for computational social scientist that will advance the understanding of human computer interaction. This will be done by standardizing metadata specifications (OCDX manifests) and building an infrastructure for storing, describing, analyzing, and sharing datasets. This will enable scientist to answer important questions about our society

## Our Project
You can find our implementation of OCDX [here](http://ec2-35-161-12-137.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)


##### Home Page
The initial page is a search, which is currently non-functional. When fully implemented, you will have the ability to search manifests by multiple categories:
- Title
- Author
- Date
- Description


#### Browse Page
If you are not sure of what category you want to search through, you can click on browse in the nav-bar. This will lead you to a page where we display all manifests by default and you have the opportunity to narrow down the displayed manifests through another search by.

#### Upload Page
The upload page is for social scientist to upload their manifests onto the OCDX platform.

#### Profile Page
You can login through a google account. You do not have to create an account on the OCDX platform. The profile page will display all your listed manifests.
