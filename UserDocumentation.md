# OCDX Web Application

## What is OCDX
The premise behind OCDX is that onlie behavior creates an enormous amount of digital data that can be used for social science research. Research into human-computer interaction dates back to 1995. Up until now, this research has been conducted independently benefiting only the site holder who has access to data they mine from their users. However, there is a large amount of interest in knowing how humans interact with technology.

**Open Community Data Exchange** (OCDX) is an infastructure for computational social scientist that will advance the understanding of human computer interaction. This will be done by standardizing metadata specifications (OCDX manifests) and building an infastructure for storing, describing, analyzing, and sharing datasets. This will enable scientist to answer important questions about our society
