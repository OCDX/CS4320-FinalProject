Use these commands in the mongo shell to initalize database
(You don't really need to, mongo can handle not having these commands and will still work just fine. 
Any operation that requires a collection where one does not exist will just create that collection.
i.e. db.foo.insert({"name": "foo1"}) will create a collection foo if one does not already exist)

db.createCollection("Manifests")
db.createCollection("Fs.files")
db.createCollection("Fs.chunks")
db.createCollection("Users")
